Human Activity-Optimized CRISPR Knockout Library (3 sub-libraries in lentiCRISPRv1)
========

## PURPOSE
The Sabatini/Lander CRISPR pooled library is optimized for cleavage activity, in order to maximize the likelihood of gene knockout. ([Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6264/1096))

The library is split into three sub-libraries. Two tubes each contain 90,000 gRNAs each or 5 sgRNAs per gene. The third tube contains 5,000 gRNAs.

## VECTOR BACKBONE
[lentiCRISPR v1](https://www.addgene.org/49535/)- **Note**: This plasmid has been discontinued, as an updated version is available. For confirmation of screen hits, Addgene encourages users to use the updated [lentiCRISPR v2](https://www.addgene.org/52961/), which can be requested separately.
